## Introduction

The Ichiban is the cooking and recipe generation based on the users' health conditions.<br />
The system would restore the information of users, including the age, the height, the weight and the sex. Each usage would collect the food ingredients then generate possible combinations of the meal with the calories suggestions.

## User Stories

- **Team Story - Main Usecase**<br />
  As a user, I want to be able to select ingredients from categories like veggies, meat, staple food, and kitchenware, so that I can generate a list of possible recipes based on my preferences. I want to see a clear list of the generated recipes and easy access to the tutorials. This will help me discover new meals that I can easily prepare with what I already have.
